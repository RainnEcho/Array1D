This is a new data structure named Graph1D which constructs a weighted and undirected graph that can sort all the edges in a 1D array using a coordinate-to-index formula.
Graph1D has a space complexity of O(E) and a time complexity of O(E log E) in Minimum Spanning Tree generation.
Do note that the users can operate the structure as if they are operating an adjacency matrix, all the conversions are done automatically.
